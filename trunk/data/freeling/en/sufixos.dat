# 1 Suffix to erase form word form (e.g: gatito - ito = gat)
# 2 Suffix (* for emtpy string) to add to the resulting root
#   to rebuild the lemma that must be searched in dictionary 
#   (e.g:  gat+o = gato)
# 3 Regexp condition on the parole tag of found dictionary entry
# 4 Parole tag for suffixed word (* = keep tag in dictionary entry)
# 5 Check lemma adding accents
# 6 Enclitic suffix (special accent behaviour in Spanish)
# 7 Lemma to assign: 0-lemma in matching dict entry, 1-original form, 2-root found in dict.
# 8 Consider the suffix always, not only for unknown words.
# 9 How to decompose word if necessary (see uer manual)
