=============================
*         Matxin            *
=============================

An Open Source transfer Machine Translation engine.


Requirements
============
Before proceding to install Matxin, please make sure you have lttoolbox-svn
(Apertium), freeling-svn, and libxml2 installed on your system.

Also, you will need a GCC compiler 3.x or higher.


Installation
============
After meeting the requirements, you can run the usual installation steps:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install


Configure options
=================
Matxin ships with Spanish and English language support by default, but you
can override this and disable a language of your choice by setting a configure
flag. At the moment, these flags are available:

  --disable-es : disables Spanish language support
  --disable-en : disables English language support

As Matxin requires some external libraries, you may want to specify their
locations in case they are not found or if you have them installed in an
unusual location. These are the available options:

  --with-libxml2=DIR : Look for libxml2 include/libs in DIR
  --with-freeling=DIR : Look for freeling include/libs in DIR
  --with-lttoolbox=DIR : Look for lttoolbox include/libs in DIR
  --with-fries=DIR : Look for libfries include/libs in DIR
  --with-omlet=DIR : Look for libomlet include/libs in DIR
  --with-libcfg=DIR : Look for libcfg+ include/libs in DIR
  --with-pcre=DIR : Look for pcre include/libs in DIR
  --with-berkeley=DIR : Look for Berkeley db_cxx include/libs in DIR

configure script also accepts some other, not widely useful, options. Run
./configure --help for more details.


Troubleshooting
===============
If you have installed the libraries required by Matxin in an unusual location, you may also want to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
