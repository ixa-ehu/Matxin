=============================
*         Matxin            *
=============================

An Open Source transfer Machine Translation engine.


Requirements
============
Before proceding to install Matxin, please make sure you have lttoolbox-2.0
(Apertium), freeling-2.0, and libxml2 installed on your system.

Also, you will need a GCC compiler 3.x or higher.


Important note
==============
As this is a pre-release of version of Matxin, there is no English dictionary
yet so you should disable english language support at configure time by using
the --disable-en flag.


Installation
============
After that, you can run the usual installation steps:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install


Configure options
=================
Matxin ships with Spanish and English language support by default, but you
can override this and disable a language of your choice setting a configure
flag. At the moment, these flags are available:

  --disable-es : disables Spanish language support
  --disable-en : disables English language support

As Matxin requires some external libraries, you may want to specify their
locations in case they are not found or if you have them installed in a
non-usual location. These are the available options:

  --with-libxml2=DIR : Look for libxml2 include/libs in DIR
  --with-freeling=DIR : Look for freeling include/libs in DIR
  --with-lttoolbox=DIR : Look for lttoolbox include/libs in DIR
  --with-fries=DIR : Look for libfries include/libs in DIR
  --with-omlet=DIR : Look for libomlet include/libs in DIR
  --with-libcfg=DIR : Look for libcfg+ include/libs in DIR
  --with-pcre=DIR : Look for pcre include/libs in DIR
  --with-berkeley=DIR : Look for Berkeley db_cxx include/libs in DIR

configure script also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
./configure --help for more details.
