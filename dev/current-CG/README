The CG .rlx files for this pair are converted from

In case there are changes made upstream, it's nice to be able to
quickly diff the new ones with these.

The conversion is quite simple though, since the originals use CG the
SET/LIST thing extensively, we can keep rules like

  REMOVE Imp IF (0 ("um")) ;

since Imp here is a SET (by just changing the LIST/SET definition).


However, rules like:

  REMOVE ("hera" imp) IF (0 ("her"));

need to be converted to:

  REMOVE ("hera" Imp) IF (0 ("her"));
