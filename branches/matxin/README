2. Goals of the Matxin-CG branch
   
    This should be general enough that it could be used either in the
    way Matxin has been used before:
    
        FreeLing morphology => FreeLing dependency analysis =>
        Matxin-transfer => lttoolbox generation
    
    or with a dependency analysis from VISL CG-3 as input to
    Matxin-transfer:
    
        lttoolbox or other morphology => CG dependency analysis =>
        Matxin-transfer => lttoolbox generation

    We don't want to make changes that make it language-pair
    dependent, nor that break the old Matxin behaviour.
